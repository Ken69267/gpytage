Note: GPytage must be run under an account that can read/write to /etc/portage,
or through su, sudo, or root.

GPytage is a utility that helps manage Portage's user config files with a GTK
interface. It supports the standard configuration file such as
package.keywords and the directory type such as 
package.keywords/foo. Directories can be of any depth.

GPytage allows you to edit, add, and remove entries from your package files with
an easy to use interface.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
>=dev-lang/python-2.6
>=dev-python/pygtk-2.14
and of course portage!

== INSTALLATION ==
Installation is accomplished through the setup.py script. 

# python setup.py install

== RUNNING FROM A LOCAL CHECKOUT ==
To run gpytage from this folder without installing:

# cd scripts
# ./gpytage -l

== TESTING ==
If you do not want to run GPytage over your real portage files, the -t flag
will instead use the directory /etc/testportage/. This can be used to safely
test without harming your config.

== BUGS AND FEATURE REQUESTS ==
