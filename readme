WARNING: THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. BEFORE USING PLEASE BACKUP YOUR /etc/portage/ DIRECTORY.

Note: GPytage must be run under an account that can read/write to /etc/portage, or through su, sudo, or root.

GPytage is a utility that helps manage portage's package. files with a GTK interface. It supports the package.*/* structure as well as the traditional package.[keywords, unmask, mask, use] file structure. 

GPytage allows you to edit, add, and remove entries from your package files with an easy to use interface.

== Planned Features ==
-Implement the creation of a subfile from a package.* file that isn't already a directory.

-Implement reordering of rows, drag and drop support.

-Implement full keyboard support and navigation.

-Deletion of files and subfiles (clearing?)

-Possible integration with a search tool/portage for further integration and ease of adding packages. (Maybe a search that one could click on a package to add to a package.* file.)
